# Day 03 - Mull It Over

An exercise in regular expressions and simple langage interpreters.

Part 2 is basically a three instruction language

mul(9,9)  // A multiplication express
do        // expression evaluator
don't     // essentially a comment.

To match Part 2 I redid Part 1 as a single expression language
